## This project will soon be updated to function under Angular 4 and the updated CLI

#A simple material design app, include Material, firebase and http modules

# Material

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.20-4.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build -prod` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy

I recomment checking out `https://coryrylan.com/blog/deploy-angular-cli-apps-to-firebase` for a simple tutorial and firebase deployment.
